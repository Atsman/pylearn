# Analysis of Algorithms

The main idea of asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of effiency of algorithms.

## Two types of complexity

*Time complexity*

Measure growth order of execution time.

*Space complexity*

Mesure growth order of space used by algo.

## Big O

Big O - upper bound on time complexity.
